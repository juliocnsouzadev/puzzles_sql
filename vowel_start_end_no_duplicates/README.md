## Scenario
In this scenario, we have a database table named `STATION` that contains information about cities. The `STATION` table has the following schema:

- `ID`: The unique identifier for each city.
- `CITY`: The name of the city (VARCHAR).
- `COUNTRYCODE`: The country code of the city (VARCHAR).
- `DISTRICT`: The district where the city is located (VARCHAR).
- `POPULATION`: The population of the city (NUMBER).

We need to retrieve a list of city names from the `STATION` table, where both the first and last characters of the city name are vowels (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'). The result should not contain any duplicate city names.

## Query
The SQL query to achieve the desired result is as follows:

```sql
/*
Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u)
as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
*/

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
WHERE 
SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
AND
SUBSTRING(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
```

## Query Explanation
Let's break down the query step by step:

1. `SELECT DISTINCT CITY`: This part of the query selects the `CITY` column from the `STATION` table and applies the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove any duplicate city names from the result set.

2. `FROM STATION`: This specifies that we are querying the `STATION` table.

3. `WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u')`: The `WHERE` clause filters the rows based on the condition that the first character of the city name (obtained using `SUBSTRING`) must be one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'.

4. `AND SUBSTRING(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u')`: The `AND` operator is used to combine the previous condition with another condition. Here, we check that the last character of the city name (obtained using `SUBSTRING` and `LENGTH`) must also be one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'.

The final result of the query will be a list of distinct city names from the `STATION` table, where both the first and last characters are vowels.

Make sure to have the `STATION` table available in the database for the query to execute successfully.

Note: The above explanation assumes that you have access to the database containing the `STATION` table with appropriate permissions to execute the query.
