## Scenario
In this scenario, we have a database table named `TRIANGLES` that contains information about triangles. The `TRIANGLES` table has the following schema:

- `ID`: The unique identifier for each triangle.
- `A`: The length of side A of the triangle (NUMBER).
- `B`: The length of side B of the triangle (NUMBER).
- `C`: The length of side C of the triangle (NUMBER).

We need to identify the type of each triangle based on its three side lengths and output one of the following statements for each triangle in the `TRIANGLES` table:

- `Equilateral`: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
- `Isosceles`: It's a triangle with two sides of equal length.
- `Scalene`: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
- `Not A Triangle`: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a valid triangle.

## Query
The SQL query to achieve the desired result is as follows:

```sql
/* Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES
   table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements
   for each record in the table:

   Equilateral: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
   Isosceles: It's a triangle with two sides of equal length.
   Scalene: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
   Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle. */

SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B <= C THEN
                'Not A Triangle'
            ELSE 
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```

## Query Explanation
Let's break down the query step by step:

1. `SELECT CASE ... END`: This part of the query uses the `CASE` expression to evaluate different conditions and return different values based on those conditions.

2. `WHEN A + B <= C THEN 'Not A Triangle'`: The first `WHEN` condition checks whether the sum of sides A and B is less than or equal to side C. If this condition is true, it means the given lengths A, B, and C do not form a valid triangle, so the query returns 'Not A Triangle' for that row.

3. `ELSE ... END`: The `ELSE` keyword specifies the default action if none of the previous `WHEN` conditions are met.

4. `WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'`: This `WHEN` condition checks if all three sides A, B, and C are equal. If this condition is true, it means the triangle is equilateral, and the query returns 'Equilateral' for that row.

5. `WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'`: This `WHEN` condition checks if at least two sides of the triangle are equal (isosceles triangle). If this condition is true, the query returns 'Isosceles' for that row.

6. `ELSE 'Scalene'`: If none of the above conditions are met, it means the triangle has three sides of differing lengths (scalene triangle), and the query returns 'Scalene' for that row.

The final result of the query will be a list of statements identifying the type of each triangle in the `TRIANGLES` table based on their side lengths.

Make sure to have the `TRIANGLES` table available in the database for the query to execute successfully.

Note: The above explanation assumes that you have access to the database containing the `TRIANGLES` table with appropriate permissions to execute the query.
