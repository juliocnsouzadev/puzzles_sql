## Scenario
In this scenario, we have a database table named `TRIANGLES` that contains information about triangles. The `TRIANGLES` table has the following schema:

- `ID`: The unique identifier for each triangle.
- `A`: The length of side A of the triangle (NUMBER).
- `B`: The length of side B of the triangle (NUMBER).
- `C`: The length of side C of the triangle (NUMBER).

We need to identify the type of each triangle based on its three side lengths and output one of the following statements for each triangle in the `TRIANGLES` table:

- `Equilateral`: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
- `Isosceles`: It's a triangle with two sides of equal length.
- `Scalene`: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
- `Not A Triangle`: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a valid triangle.

## Query
The SQL query to achieve the desired result is as follows:

```sql
/* Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES
   table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements
   for each record in the table:

   Equilateral: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
   Isosceles: It's a triangle with two sides of equal length.
   Scalene: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
   Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle. */

SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```

## Query Explanation
Let's break down the query step by step:

1. `SELECT CASE ... END`: This part of the query uses the `CASE` expression to evaluate different conditions and return different values based on those conditions.

2. `WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN`: The first `WHEN` condition checks whether the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side. If this condition is true for all three sides, it means the given lengths A, B, and C form a valid triangle, and the inner `CASE` expression will be evaluated.

3. `CASE ... END`: The inner `CASE` expression checks whether the triangle is `Equilateral`, `Isosceles`, or `Scalene` based on the lengths of its sides.

4. `WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'`: This `WHEN` condition checks if all three sides A, B, and C are equal. If this condition is true, it means the triangle is equilateral, and the inner `CASE` expression returns 'Equilateral'.

5. `WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'`: This `WHEN` condition checks if at least two sides of the triangle are equal (isosceles triangle). If this condition is true, the inner `CASE` expression returns 'Isosceles'.

6. `ELSE 'Scalene'`: If none of the above conditions are met in the inner `CASE` expression, it means the triangle has three sides of differing lengths (scalene triangle), and the inner `CASE` expression returns 'Scalene'.

7. `ELSE 'Not A Triangle'`: If the outer `WHEN` condition is not met (i.e., the given lengths A, B, and C do not form a valid triangle), the outer `CASE` expression returns 'Not A Triangle'.

The final result of the query will be a list of statements identifying the type of each triangle in the `TRIANGLES` table based on their side lengths.

Make sure to have the `TRIANGLES` table available in the database for the query to execute successfully.
