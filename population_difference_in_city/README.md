Sure, here's the README.md file explaining the scenario and detailing the provided SQL query:

## Scenario
In this scenario, we have a database table named `CITY` that contains information about cities. The `CITY` table has the following schema:

- `ID`: The unique identifier for each city.
- `NAME`: The name of the city (VARCHAR2).
- `COUNTRYCODE`: The country code of the city (VARCHAR2).
- `DISTRICT`: The district where the city is located (VARCHAR2).
- `POPULATION`: The population of the city (NUMBER).

We need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum populations among all cities in the `CITY` table.

## Query
The SQL query to achieve the desired result is as follows:

```sql
/* Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.
   Input Format: The CITY table is described as follows:
   CITY
   Field           Type
   ID              NUMBER
   NAME            VARCHAR2 ( 17 )
   COUNTRYCODE     VARCHAR2 ( 3 )
   DISTRICT        VARCHAR2 ( 20 )
   POPULATION      NUMBER */

SELECT max(population) - min(population) as difference from CITY;
```

## Query Explanation
Let's break down the query step by step:

1. `SELECT max(population) - min(population) as difference`: This part of the query calculates the difference between the maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) values of the `POPULATION` column in the `CITY` table. It uses the `AS` keyword to rename the calculated difference as `difference` in the result set.

2. `FROM CITY`: This specifies that we are querying the `CITY` table.

The `max(population)` function returns the maximum value of the `POPULATION` column, and `min(population)` function returns the minimum value of the `POPULATION` column. By subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value, we obtain the difference between the maximum and minimum populations.

The final result of the query will be a single value representing the difference between the maximum and minimum populations among all cities in the `CITY` table.

Make sure to have the `CITY` table available in the database for the query to execute successfully.

Note: The above explanation assumes that you have access to the database containing the `CITY` table with appropriate permissions to execute the query.
